Quick and dirty twilio calls.

0. Make a ~/.robofriend.json like this:

{
  "base": "BASEURL_WHERE_TWIMLS_LIVES",
  "numbers": {
      "name": "+15555555555",
      "othername": "+16666666666"
  }
}

1. Get a twilio account, you'll need to set the following in your bashrc. If it's not a paid account there will be an annoying message played before yours.

export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="YOURSID"
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="YOURAUTHTOKEN"

2. Add an authed number to twilio through their web ui. This number will need to be in your .robofriend.json too.

3. Make a Twiml with an xml extension; Here is a really simple one:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <Say>Hi John, this is a message from Bob Corsaro. Just wanted you to know I'm thinking of you and I wrote this script to tell you. You are sick AND tight and I'm glad to call you my friend.</Say>
</Response>

4. Upload it to the base url defined above.

5. pip install twilio

6. invoke call.py

python call.py <appname> <fromname> <toname>

appname maps to <base>/<appname>.xml, this is what twilio will fetch to get it's instructions.
fromname and toname map to phone numbers in the .robofriend.json file.
